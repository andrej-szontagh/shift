## SHIFT Engine

This repository contains my already quite old C++ project that I really enjoyed to make.

It's an OpenGL base real-time 3D rendering game engine designed for big open spaces and outdoor environments.

## Motivation

I developed this engine for a personal game project that never become reality.

I decided to share the project to show what I love to do and what I have spend quite some time working on.

## Build

Don't try to build this, it's here only for informative purposes.
